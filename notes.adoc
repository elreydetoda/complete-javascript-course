== 02 JS Funamentals

=== Part 1

.cmds run in browser dev tools console
[source,javascript]
```
alert("hello world!")
let js = 'amazing'
if (js === 'amazing') alert('Javascript is fun!')
js = 'boring'
if (js === 'amazing') alert('Javascript is fun!')

```

* JavaScript (JS) - a high level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language
** multi-paradigm - can use multiple programming styles (imperative and declarative (ways to structure our code))
* role of JS in web dev
** html = content ( noun )
** css = presentation ( adjectives )
** js = building web applications/dynamic programming language ( verbs )

* dynamic effects and web applications in the browser
* JS is used for lots of things, not just for client side code

* Value is a piece of data (i.e. string or number)
** smallest piece of information in JS
* variables used to assign values
* convention is to use camelCase
** variables can't start with digit
** variables can only container alphanumeric + `_` + `$`
** can't use JS keywords
** `name` is a reserved keyword, but legal to use
** convention to not use upper case letter, because used for specific thing (probably class names) in OOP
** constance that never change = all caps

* every value is either an object (using `{}`) or a primitive value (prob. int, str, etc...)
* other value information

.7 primitive data types
image:Screenshot_20211128_153419.png[7 primitive data types]
+
* value holds data type, not variable
* opperator: `typeof`
* `let` is used for declaration
* dynamic typing, just re-assign variable with another type (can check with `typeof varString`)
* declare empty variable = undefined
* `typeof null` -> object, but should return `null`. Never fixed for reverse compatibility, but is considered a bug in the `typeof` function
* variables definitions
** `let` - when variables need to be mutable
*** block scoped
** `const` - creates an immutable variable
*** can't create empty variables
** `var` - appears to work like `let`, but works differently under the hood
*** function scoped
*** old way for defining variables
** `let` and `const` were defined in ES6, and `var` was old way
** use `const` by default, unless you need mutable variables
*** better to make immutable variables by default to help prevent bugs
** don't need to define variables? ( `lastName = s` works )
*** instead of being scoped it will create a property on global object
* mutate a variable = re-assigning it

.operators
|===
| math operators | all normal ones
| assignment operators | `+=`, `*=`, `--`, `++`
| comparison operators | all normal ones
|===

* operator precedence: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table
* template literals for constucting strings
** require using `` for string to template, or else won't work
** brought with ES6
** quite a lot of developers use `` for every string, so they don't have to think about which quotes to use
** used for multiline strings
* if else = control structure
* type conversion/coercion
** NaN when operation fails to produce a new number (invalid number)


==== truthy vs falsy

* truthy & falsy are values that convert to the corrisponding bool value when converted to boolean value
* 5 falsy values
** 0
** ''
** undefined
** null
** NaN
* almost always happens implicetly with type coercion
** logical context
*** if else statement
*** logical operators

==== Equality operators

* `===` = strict equality operator (doesn't perform type coercion)
* `==` = loose equality operator (does perform type coercion)
** avoid AS much as possible! use `===` instead
* `!==` = strict
* `!=` = loose

==== Misc

* switch statement compares with strict equality operator
* statements vs expressions
** expression - produces a value
** statements - bigger piece of code that doesn't produce value by itself (i.e. if statement)
** template literals require expression not a statement (i.e. needs a value)
* conditional (ternary) operator = `?`
** ternary operator allowed in template literal, so allows an if else operation inside template literal

==== JS releases

.brief history of JS
image:Screenshot_20211128_205343.png[History of JS]

* backwards compatibility: Don't break the web
** 1997 JS code still work on modern JS engines
** while they are new version, they aren't breaking like in other programming languages
** old features are **never** removed
** not really "new versions", just incremental updates (releases)
** websites keep working forever!
* not forwards compatible
** development vs production scenarios
*** development - use latest google chrome to test out new JS features
*** production - use babel to transpile and polyfill your code (converting back to ES5 to ensure browser compatibility for all users)
** ES5
*** fully supported ina ll browsers (down to IE9 from 2011)
*** ready to be used today
** ES6+ (ES6/ES2015 -> ES2020)
*** well supported in all **modern** browsers
*** no support in older browsers
*** can use **most** features in production with transpiling and polyfilling
*** check compatibility - http://kangax.github.io/compat-table
** ESNext: future versions of the language (new feature proposals that reach stage 4)
*** browsers can start implementing as soon as stage 3
*** can already use **some** features in production with transpiling and polyfilling

.why ES5 is still important to know

=== Part 2

* strict mode - help make sure we write more secure JS code: `"use strict";`
** need to be at beginning of file (comments can come first, because JS will ignore them)
** can also enable on a per function/block, but probably just do at beginning of each file
** 2 reasons why important
*** prevents us from doing certain things
*** helps prevent errors, and will cause errors to be visible when sometimes JS will fail silently
** helps let you know if word will potentially be reserved
** almost like bash hardened mode: https://elrey.casa/bash/scripting/harden

==== Functions

* start with `function` keyword
** function body is everything between `{}`
* calling/invoking/running = using the function previously defined
* parameter = placeholder inside of function
* argument = actual value passed into function to fill in parameter

===== Declarations vs Expressions

* anonymous function = function without a name
* expressions is an anonymous function assigned to variable

IMPORTANT: expressions produce a value *&*
functions are just a value (i.e. why you can store it into a variable)

* declarations
** can call function before defined in code
** happens because of hoisting
* he prefers function expressions
* arrow function (ES6 *ONLY*)
** they don't get a `this` keyword
